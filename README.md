So... this is basically Reveal.js, but with the Grunt/Node stuff stripped out.

I just take a release snapshot of Reveal, stripped out what I did not want.

My workflow (and I assume yours as well) is that you want a template presentation to start from, but are not interested in cloning or forking as you will want to change lots of stuff.  So... I just get an archive of the repo, edit some basic stuff, and check it into a new repo.
